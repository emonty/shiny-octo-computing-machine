Utilities for projects using `pbr`_.

`pbr`_ is very opinionated about how things should be done. As a result,
there are a set of actions that become easy to deal with generically for
any `pbr`_ based project. **pbrx** is a collection of utilities that contain
support for such actions.

.. note::

  Each of the utilities has a primary focus of working for projects using
  pbr. However, some of them will also work just fine for non-pbr-based
  projects. When that is the case, the utility will be marked appropriately.
